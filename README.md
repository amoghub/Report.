# Report.

Report. is a news briefing iOS application built to give you articles on the latest news of today. It comes with two tabs, "Daily View" and "Search," which users can conveniently switch between from with the tab bar on the bottom of the screen. Upon finding the article that peaks your interest, you can tap on it to find more information!

## App Design

### <ins> Daily View </ins>

This tab is what the app initally opens to, and showcases the top news articles from around the United States. Daily View uses the newsAPI to get the latest news from their dedicated API servers. Data that is on this page will be saved and updated daily, so you don't have to worry about losing an article that you wanted to look into until the next day.

### <ins> Search </ins>

If the user wants to find out news articles about their favorite topic then the Search tab is the perfect place. Search uses the GNewsAPI to get keyworded responses that filter to the user's word inputted in the search bar. The result is the user being able to see news articles that they searched for, all with a seamless click.

NEW:
Users can close their app and be brought back to the same tab which they were on from their last use.
